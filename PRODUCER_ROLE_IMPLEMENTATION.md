  - `canCreateTask`: Allows producers to create tasks
  - `canViewHardDrives`: All users can view hard drives
  - `canEditHardDrives`: Only admin/senior can edit hard drives

#### User Management

## Role Hierarchy

1. **Admin**: Full system access
2. **Senior**: Task completion + user management
3. **Operator**: Basic viewing and request submission
4. **Producer**: Read-only hard drives + task creation (no assignments) + separate schedule section

## Database Migration Instructions

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Start local Supabase instance
npx supabase start

# Apply migrations
npx supabase db push
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `add_producer_role_manual.sql`

## Testing the Implementation

### Creating a Producer User
1. Login as an Admin user
2. Go to User Management
3. Create a new user with role "Producer"
4. Verify the user appears with the purple Producer badge

### Testing Producer Permissions
1. Login as a Producer user
2. Navigate to Hard Drives - should see read-only view
3. Try to create a task - should not see assignee selection
4. Verify task creation works but without assignments
5. Confirm edit/delete buttons are hidden

### Testing Schedule Exclusion
1. Login as an Admin user
2. Go to Schedule view
3. Verify that Producer users appear in a separate "Producers" section below "Operators"
4. Confirm that the order is: Operators ‚Üí Producers ‚Üí Technical Leaders

### Testing Task Assignment
1. Login as an Admin or Senior user
2. Create a new task or edit an existing task
3. Try to assign the task to a Producer user
4. Verify that Producer users do not appear in the assignee list

### Testing Task Creation
1. As a Producer, create a new task
2. Verify the task is created successfully
3. Check that no assignees are added
4. Confirm the success message indicates Producer restrictions

## Security Considerations

- Producers cannot escalate their privileges
- All hard drive modifications are blocked at the UI level
- Task assignments are automatically cleared in the backend
- Role-based access control is enforced throughout the application
- Producers appear in schedule views but in their own separate section
- Producers cannot be assigned to tasks by other users

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the Producer role:
- Add ability to view task comments
- Allow Producers to update task descriptions
- Add specific Producer dashboard with relevant metrics
- Implement audit logging for Producer actions
- Add Producer-specific task categories or labels

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Role not appearing in dropdown**: Ensure database migration is applied
2. **Producer can still assign tasks**: Check that `isProducer` logic is working
3. **Hard drive edit buttons visible**: Verify `isProducer` prop is passed correctly
4. **Producer doesn't appear in schedule**: Check that Producers are included in the users array
5. **Producer appears in assignee list**: Verify `assignableUsers` filtering is working

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for role-related logs
2. Verify current user role in AuthContext
3. Confirm database enum includes 'producer'
4. Test with different user roles to isolate issues
5. Check that `user.role !== 'producer'` filtering is applied consistently for task assignments
6. Verify that Producers are properly separated in schedule views
